#Goals
The purpose of this repository is to provide a codebase of best practices and sound software engineering techniques, while building and maintaining a fully tested support ticketing backend system.
#Description
dimo-core allows clients send tickets to a server via a REST API, providing their location, pictures and a message.
All the tickets are saved in a database and are accessible by admins using the admin web interface.
